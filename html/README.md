MOVIES WEBSITE PROJECT By Veronika Ostrovska
=======================

## Requirements

For development, you will need **Gulp** installed on your environement. Because Gulp is built on **Node.js** (Javascript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 Javascript engine), first you need to install Node.js. If you do not have Node installed already, you can get it by [downloading the package installer from Node's website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

When you're done with installing Node, you can install Gulp by using the following command in the command line:
```
sudo npm install gulp -g
```
The `-g` flag in this command tells npm to install Gulp globally onto your computer, which allows you to use the `gulp` command anywhere on your system.

*Note: Mac users need the `sudo` keyword.

## Install

```
$ git clone https://github.com/VeronikaOstrovska/movie_project.git
$ cd movie_project
$ npm install

... then open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8002/](http://localhost:8002/)
